JAVASCRIPT COMPONENTS

MIt depends on the specific functionality that you want to add to the CV page. Here are a few examples of JavaScript components that you could add to the HTML CV template:

    Navigation menu: You could add a navigation menu with links to different sections of the CV page, such as Education and Work Experience. This could be accomplished using JavaScript to listen for clicks on the menu items and then scrolling the page to the corresponding section.

    Form validation: If you have a contact form on the page, you could use JavaScript to validate the form input before it is submitted. For example, you could check that the email address is in a valid format and that all required fields are filled out.

    Interactive elements: You could add interactive elements to the page, such as a button that toggles between a list and a grid view of the skills section. This could be accomplished using JavaScript to listen for clicks on the button and then modify the CSS styles of the skills section to switch between the two views.

    Image carousel: You could add an image carousel to the page to showcase images of the projects you've worked on. This could be accomplished using JavaScript to listen for clicks on the carousel navigation buttons and then swapping out the images.

    Print function: You could add a print function to the page, so that the user can print a hard copy of the CV. This could be done by using JavaScript to call the browser's built-in print function when the user clicks on a button.

Please note that these are just examples, you should evaluate your specific needs and pick the components that fits better for your case.
