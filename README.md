    Navigation menu: You could add a navigation menu with links to different sections of the CV page, such as Education and Work Experience. This could be accomplished using JavaScript to listen for clicks on the menu items and then scrolling the page to the corresponding section.

    Image carousel: You could add an image carousel to the page to showcase images of the projects you've worked on. This could be accomplished using JavaScript to listen for clicks on the carousel navigation buttons and then swapping out the images.

    Print function: You could add a print function to the page, so that the user can print a hard copy of the CV. This could be done by using JavaScript to call the browser's built-in print function when the user clicks on a button.
